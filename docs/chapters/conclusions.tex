In conclusion this coursework project helped me understand the importance of reliability of code and the steps to maintain and update repositories. I Also helped me to improve my understanding as well as confidence C and improved my problem-solving skill. Besides programming, designing textures was also something I learned. If I were to do this project again, I would plan out a game more thoroughly and use a software development life cycle such as sprint and a Kanban board to manage the project. Furthermore, I could have more comments and audited the progress better to reduce setbacks in managing a project of a multiple files.

I have recognized that I could improve my productivity if I learn to use Git and a testing framework as I struggled to maintain my code and often failed to remember where I last modified code. And this could also aid in have a more inadept testing of features as I could test and push iteratively.
